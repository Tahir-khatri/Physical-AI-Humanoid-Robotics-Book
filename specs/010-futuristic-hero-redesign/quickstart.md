# Quickstart Guide: Futuristic Hero Section Implementation

This guide provides instructions for setting up the development environment to implement the futuristic hero section.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.0 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Setup & Installation

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
    All frontend work is done within the `Book-Frontend` directory.

    ```bash
    cd Book-Frontend
    ```

2.  **Install 3D Dependencies**:
    Install `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, and `@react-three/drei` to build the 3D hero section.

    ```bash
    npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server**:
    Start the local development server to see your changes live.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4.  **Verify Setup**:
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser. The site should load without errors, and you can now begin implementing the new `HeroSection` component.

# API Contracts: Frontend RAG Integration

**Date**: 2026-01-02
**Feature**: `014-frontend-rag-integration`

This feature does not define any new API contracts.

It consumes the existing API endpoints and data contracts that were defined and implemented as part of the RAG Agent Backend feature (`013-rag-agent-backend`).

The endpoints that will be consumed are:
- `POST /chat`
- `POST /chat/contextual`
